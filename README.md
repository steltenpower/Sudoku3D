# Sudoku3D (virtual and physical)

What if you'd turn a (simplified) Sudoku like

into a 3D-representation similar to

but with horizontal distances varied a bit to show groups, where each LED is multi-colored to show if Z is the value to fill the X,Y square, maybe with: OFF=no (after tap), GREEN=yes (after hold), ORANGE=undetermined, RED=error

I wonder
- if it's fun to play
- how people cooperate
- if people figure out the logic if you don't tell 'm it's a representation of Sudoku

plus: Sudoku is a nice problem to practice parallel playing/programming/logic on, and this cube a nice thing to shape the rather low-level circuitry around.

It can be somewhat like ...
